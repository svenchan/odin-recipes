    <p>This is an easy recipe and takes less than 30 minutes to put together. It always tastes good. 
        Serve it with extra cheese for the little ones and wih some chilly flakes for tjose who like a bit of a kick. 
    </p>
    <p>If you are used to buying your tomato sauce ready made this might seem as more work, but as you get used to making your own sauce, you'll never
        buy it again. You can add fresh herbs in summer and if you like a warmer umami flavor yopu can add soy sauce too.
