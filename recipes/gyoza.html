        <p>This is one of my favorite binge foods. I like to make way to many and eat untill I'm completely stuffed.
            I enjoy making this with other people because it takes some time to fill and fold all the gyoza. 
            Having many helpers speeds up the process and provides a moment where nobody is on their phone and in the same room.
        </p>
        <p>Originally from china but this dish can be found as a staple in many asian countries. This is 
            the Japanese version. Made with pork, ginger and garlic it is sure to put a smile on everybody's face.
            Fried on the bottom and steamed on the top, a treat for all the senses. We ussualy eat it with ponzu,
            a sour soy sauce, and chilly oil. All you need is a big fry pan with a lid.
