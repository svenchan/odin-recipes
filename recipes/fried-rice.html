        <p>I love fried rice because you can add anything you like. It's a great way to finnish any left overs
            you might have lying about. Fried rice is best made with left over rice that's gone a bit hard. 
            If you don't have a rice cooker, having left over rice might not happen as often though. Instead you can cook 
            the rice and let it cool down a bit before using it in this recipe. </p>
        <p>I like to make it with chicken and plenty of vegetables. But you can really add anything here.
            Sometimes I use a lot of spices to give it more of curry flavour and sometimes I leave the flavours very clean.
            Especially nice if you want to make it for breakfast. 
        </p>
