        <p>This Page contains a collection of my favorite recipes. 
            Most are very easy and can be made in less than 30 minutes. 
            Others are more involved and are recipes I like to cook when I have a bit more time.</p>

        </div>
    <p>This is my all time go to recipe. 
       I make it when I have no inspiration or when I'm a bit under the weather.
       It always tastes good to me however bad I feel myself.</p>

        <p>I love fried rice because you can add anything you like. It's a great way to finnish any left overs
            you might have lying about. Fried rice is best made with left over rice that's gone a bit hard. 
            If you don't have a rice cooker, having left over rice might not happen as often though. Instead you can cook 
            the rice and let it cool down a bit before using it in this recipe.

        <h2>Gyoza</h2>
        <div class="index-image-div">
            <img src="/images/gyoza.jpeg" alt="Wooden table with 5 gyoza on a plate with soy sauce">
        </div>
        <p>This is one of my favorite binge foods. I like to make way to many and eat untill I'm completely stuffed.
            I enjoy making this with other people because it takes some time to fill and fold all the gyoza. 
            Having many helpers speeds up the process and provides a moment where nobody is on their phone and in the same room.
