    <h1>Recipes</h1>
    <p>This Page contains a collection of my favorite recipes. 
        Most are very easy and can be made in less than 30 minutes. 
        Others are more involved and are recipes I like to cook when I have a bit more time.</p>

    <h2><a href="recipes/easy-pasta.html">Easy Pasta</a></h2>
    <p>This is my all time go to recipe. 
       I make it when I have no inspiration or when I'm a bit under the weather.
       It always tastes good to me however bad I feel myself.</p>
