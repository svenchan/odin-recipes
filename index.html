                <p>This Page contains a collection of my favorite recipes. 
                    Most are very easy and can be made in less than 30 minutes. 
                    Others are more involved and are recipes I like to cook when I have a bit more time.

                <p>This is my all time go to recipe. 
                I make it when I have no inspiration or when I'm a bit under the weather.
                It always tastes good to me however bad I feel myself.

            <h2><a href="recipes/fried-rice.html">Fried Rice</a></h2>
            <p>I love fried rice because you can add anything you like. It's a great way to finnish any left overs
                you might have lying about. Fried rice is best made with left over rice that's gone a bit hard. 
                If you don't have a rice cooker, having left over rice might not happen as often though. Instead you can cook 
                the rice and let it cool down a bit before using it in this recipe.

                <p>This is one of my favorite binge foods. I like to make way to many and eat untill I'm completely stuffed.
                    I enjoy making this with other people because it takes some time to fill and fold all the gyoza. 
                    Having many helpers speeds up the process and provides a moment where nobody is on their phone and in the same room.
